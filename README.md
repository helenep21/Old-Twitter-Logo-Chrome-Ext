# Old-Twitter-Logo-Chrome-Ext
A simple Chrome Extension to have the old logo on Twitter, instead of the X logo


# How to install the extension ?

First, download this repo (all the files).

Then, in Chrome, go to Extension Management > Enable Developer Mode (if not already on) > Click on "Load unpacked" > Select the folder with the download files.

Chrome will load the extension, and you should see its icon appear in the Chrome toolbar !

Visit Twitter's web version (https://twitter.com/) in a new tab, and the Twitter logo should now be replaced with your custom image :)

Side Note : should work on all chromium-based browsers (ex: Brave)
